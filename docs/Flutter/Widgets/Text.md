# Text
The [Text](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html){:target="\_blank"} widget displays a string of text with single style. The string might break across multiple lines or might all be displayed on the same line depending on the layout constraints.

The [style](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/TextStyle-class.html){:target="\_blank"} argument is optional.
